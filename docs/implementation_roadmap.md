## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Sora2 API access/documentation** → Start API research early
2. **API rate limits** → Implement proper status polling intervals
3. **Large video file handling** → Test with file size limits
4. **Browser storage limits** → Monitor IndexedDB usage
5. **CORS issues with API** → Consider proxy if needed

### Contingency Plans
- Have mock API responses ready for testing
- Implement progressive loading for large files
- Add storage quota monitoring
- Research CORS proxy solutions in advance

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] User can upload at least 10 assets
- [ ] Video generation completes within 5 minutes
- [ ] Generated videos play without buffering issues
- [ ] No data loss on page refresh
- [ ] Works smoothly on Chrome (latest version)
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in happy path

---

## Next Steps After MVP

- Multi-video composition
- Video editing capabilities
- Cloud storage integration
- Advanced prompt templates
- Batch generation
- Asset organization (folders/tags)
